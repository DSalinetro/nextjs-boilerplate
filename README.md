## About This Project
This is my personal portfolio built with **Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel**.  
It highlights my work in **branding, UI/UX, empathy-driven design, and content strategy**.

I created this site as both a design showcase and a technical build, combining:
- Custom branding & UI design  
- Accessibility features (contrast, dyslexia font, reduced motion)  
- Dynamic CMS integration with Supabase  
- Password-protected resume area for employers
