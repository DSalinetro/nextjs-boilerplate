# Danielle Salinetro — Design Portfolio

Hi, I’m Danielle Salinetro, a Creative Designer & Researcher based in Kansas City, MO. This repository powers my live portfolio: [daniellesalinetro.design](https://daniellesalinetro.design/). My work focuses on branding identity, UI/UX design, and empathy-driven frameworks that make digital experiences more human and accessible.  

Featured projects include the **Enhance Branding Portfolio**, **Hearts & Minds Empathy Concept**, and **The Empathy Audit** framework published on Medium. The site is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel, and reflects my ability to combine strong design systems with modern front-end development.
